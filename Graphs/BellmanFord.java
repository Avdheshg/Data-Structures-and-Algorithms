    this is an algo for finding the Shortest path
    V have now total 4 methods for finding the shortest path(SP) from single source
        1. DFS: used when the graph is undirected and unweighted  O(V+E)
        2. using Topological sort: when the graph is DAG and wieghted  O(V+E)
        3. Dijskastra's algo: this has no requirement as this will work for both directed/unddirected, acyclic/cyclic graph. this will not work for -ve weight edges
        4. This will work for -ve also

    The idea is to first find all the SP of One edge length, then all the SP of two edge length and so on
    It is a DP algo (bottom up manner)

    Algo: V relax all  edges V-1 times
        Here V find the Shortest distance to all vertices from src. If there is a negative weight cycle, then shortest distances are not calculated, negative weight cycle is reported.

        1.  initializes distances from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself as 0. Create an array dist[] of size |V| with all values as infinite except dist[src] where src is source vertex.
        2. This step calculates shortest distances. Do following |V|-1 times where |V| is the number of vertices in given graph. 
            a) Do following for each edge u-v 
            ………………If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v] 
            ………………….dist[v] = dist[u] + weight of edge uv
        3 .This step reports if there is a negative weight cycle in graph. Do following for each edge u-v 
            ……If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then “Graph contains negative weight cycle”

        The idea of step 3 is, step 2 guarantees the shortest distances if the graph doesn’t contain a negative weight cycle. If we iterate through all edges one more time and get a shorter path for any vertex, then there is a negative weight cycle
